\arguments{
\item{psi}{object of class psi_func}

\item{equation}{equation to base computations on. \code{"location"} and
\code{"scale"} are for the univariate case. The others are for a
multivariate location and scale problem. \code{"eta"} is for the shape of
the covariance matrix, \code{"tau"} for the size of the covariance matrix
and \code{"mu"} for the location.}

\item{dimension}{dimension for the multivariate location and scale problem.}

\item{desiredEfficiency}{scalar, specifying the desired asymptotic
efficiency, needs to be between 0 and 1.}

\item{interval}{interval in which to do the root search, passed on to
\code{\link{uniroot}}.}

\item{...}{passed on to \code{\link{uniroot}}.}
}
\description{
\code{asymptoticEfficiency} computes the theoretical asymptotic efficiency
for an M-estimator for various types of equations.
}
\details{
The asymptotic efficiency is defined as the ratio between the asymptotic
variance of the maximum likelihood estimator and the asymptotic variance
of the (M-)estimator in question.

The computations are only approximate, using numerical integration in the
general case. Depending on the regularity of the psi-function, these
approximations can be quite crude.
